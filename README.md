# Pokedex

A basic Pokedex built with React & Redux using the PokeApi!

## TODO
* Replace gulp with Webpack. I was impressed with the speed of live reloading of Dan Abramov's Webpack config in the create-react-app project.

### Install

```
npm install
```

### Run in dev server with watchers
````
gulp
````

### build
```
gulp build
```
